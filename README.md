# NOTE

This is the mh fork of arch's i3-wm package. My changes are mostly for my
use-case only.

The master branch is not where most of the action occurs, instead, look for the
relevant version you want as a tag, then see if an equivalent mh-* version
exists as well. For example: version 4.24-1 has mh-4.24-1 as its mh equivalent.
Thoses forks are kept in the pkg branch.
